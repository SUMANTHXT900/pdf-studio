# Folio — Bug & Known-Issue Registry

IDs are stable (`F-<n>`). "Resolved" entries stay recorded — they explain why the code looks the way it does. Only issues supported by code, tests, or observed behavior are listed; nothing here is invented.

## Active

### F-17 — Live scanner detection could never fire (corner shape mismatch)

- **Status.** Resolved. **Area.** Scan bridge (`scan/src/wasm.rs` envelope ↔ `app/src/studio/tools/scan/scanWorkerClient.ts` parsing; live path in `useScanProcessor.ts`). **Severity.** Medium (guidance-only: the "Document detected — capture when ready" pill never appeared; scanning itself worked).
- **Symptoms.** Live framing guidance never reported a detection even on clear pages; `liveDetected` stayed false.
- **Root cause.** The WASM glue serializes corners as `[[x, y] × 4]` arrays, but the client parsed `{x, y}` objects only — the filter yielded an empty list, so `corners` was always `null` and the status gate could never be satisfied.
- **Fix.** `parseCorners` accepts both shapes, hardened by scan protocol v2's `detected` status; the live tick now runs detection-only and reports corners honestly.
- **Verification.** Scan unit tests (detect-only corners + fallback), scan worker/client tests, canonical E2E 46/46 + 4 SKIP.

### F-13 — Hard-cached PWA with no update path after a deploy

- **Status.** Resolved (update manager). **Area.** PWA/service-worker boundary (`app/src/pwa/`, `StudioApp.tsx`, `About.tsx`). **Severity.** High (after every deploy, mobile and desktop users sat on the stale precache with no in-app recourse — only a manual hard refresh, undiscoverable on phones).
- **Symptoms.** New versions deployed to Cloudflare Pages never surfaced in the installed/open app; users had to know to hard-refresh. `registerType: 'autoUpdate'` updated the worker silently in the background while the open page kept serving old chunks.
- **Root cause.** Nothing in the app ever called `registerSW` / listened for `onNeedRefresh`, so a waiting worker had no UI. Stale-chunk recovery (F-12) only fires after a lazy import already failed.
- **Fix.** Update manager adapted from the SYNAPSE repo pattern (D16): silent launch check, global one-tap `UpdateBanner`, About "App updates" card (manual check + diagnostics log), localhost/LAN guard.
- **Verification.** 14 manager unit tests (incl. snapshot-stability regression for `useSyncExternalStore`); canonical E2E 43/43 + 4 SKIP (new: About card checks and reports local status on dev, no stray banner).
- **Follow-up 2026-09-27 (honesty + UX pass, D23 batch).** Banner now navigates to About (auto-expands details while an update waits) instead of a dead tap; `applyUpdate` shows an `applying` phase; log lines carry real timestamps and literal copy (`Re-fetching sw.js…`, `Waiting 5s for the worker to answer…`, `No new version answered within 5s…`) replacing embellished lines ("edge server", "worker integrity", "hashes match"). The mechanism was verified real: `registration.update()` re-fetches `sw.js`, `updateSW(true)` activates + reloads; no-request clicks trace to disabled-button state, the LAN guard, or DevTools filters.

### F-19 — Preview modal not viewport-anchored on tall lists (phone video report)

- **Status.** Resolved (portaled modal). **Area.** Images page list (`app/src/studio/tools/PageGrid.tsx`). **Severity.** High (on a 23-page phone list the preview image opened off-screen — the user's "light background, not the image").
- **Symptoms.** Tapping a row preview on a tall list dimmed the whole page; "Page N" + "Close" sat at the screen's bottom edge and the image itself was invisible, centered somewhere in the middle of the tall overlay. Verified in the user's screen recording (frames showed the backdrop spanning all 23 rows) and reproduced locally (backdrop rect 356×1840 on an 844px viewport).
- **Root cause.** The tool card above the modal carries `backdrop-filter` (glass style). Per spec, any non-`none` `backdrop-filter` (like `filter`) on an ancestor makes it the containing block for in-tree `position: fixed` descendants — so `fixed inset-0` resolved against the tall card, not the viewport. Proven by walking the dialog's ancestor chain (the card flagged `backdrop-filter`) while `position: fixed` itself computed correctly.
- **Fix.** The modal renders via `createPortal(..., document.body)` (escapes every ancestor; immune to any future filter/transform above it), z-index raised above the sticky header (`z-[100]`), and viewport caps use `dvh` units (`92dvh` dialog, `78dvh` image) so the Android URL bar can't crop. New E2E assertion pins it: backdrop rect must equal the viewport and the dialog must sit inside it.
- **Verification.** Tall-list (14 pages, phone viewport, scrolled to middle) probe: backdrop exactly 390×844 at scroll 873 (was 356×1840), dialog fully inside, header covered, image decodes and visible; E2E **50/50 + 4 SKIP** (new viewport-anchored check green).

### F-18 — Images previews could silently fail ("light background, not the image")

- **Status.** Resolved (hardened; the report could not be reproduced in any automated probe — see verification). **Area.** Images page list (`app/src/studio/tools/PageGrid.tsx`). **Severity.** Medium (previews are how users verify their pages).
- **Symptoms.** Real-phone report: page previews did not appear; rows showed only the light card background.
- **Root cause.** Not confirmed in reproduction. Inspection found three real silent-failure mechanisms: (1) `loading="lazy"` gated blob-URL previews (pointless for local URLs; can starve in some mobile/in-app browsers); (2) a failed decode had no recovery — Android can reclaim blob-URL storage across tab restore, leaving dead URLs; (3) neither the row nor the modal rendered any fallback, so a broken image showed as blank space indistinguishable from "still loading".
- **Fix.** Previews load eagerly; `onError` re-materializes the object URL from the retained File handle once; persistent failure renders an explicit "Preview unavailable" tile (row) / panel (modal). Modal is scroll-safe; row layout cleaned up for phones (larger thumbnails, truncated name/meta). Three E2E checks now assert previews actually decode (`naturalWidth > 0`) for uploads, the modal, and accepted scans.
- **Verification.** E2E 47→49 with the decode checks (twice green). Nine visual/functional probes: dev + deployed builds, light + dark themes, small/large/PNG/JPEG uploads, downscale path, 12-photo list after scroll, scanner review, accepted scan row, modal — all loaded correctly. If the report recurs, it is device-state-specific and the new explicit fallback will show which page failed.

### F-14 — Images → PDF output ~5× larger than the input photos (81 MB for 13 images)

- **Status.** Resolved (DCT passthrough). **Area.** Engine (`engine/src/processing/pdf/images_to_pdf/mod.rs`), engine-only — wire, protocol, and app untouched. **Severity.** High (the scanner's main output was unusable at scale: share failures, storage bloat).
- **Symptoms.** 13 phone/camera photos (~2–4 MB JPEGs each) built an ~81 MB PDF on a real phone.
- **Root cause.** The engine decoded every JPEG to raw pixels and embedded an _uncompressed_ stream (`w×h×3` bytes, no `/Filter`) — the original JPEG compression was discarded at the engine boundary. A 2500px photo entered as ~3 MB and left as ~14 MB.
- **Fix.** Baseline orientation-1 JPEGs embed byte-identical (`/DCTDecode`); progressive/YCCK/EXIF-rotated fall back to one internal q82 re-encode; PNGs keep the lossless raw path (D17).
- **Verification.** 8 new Rust tests (byte identity, DCT filter, fallback dims, parser gates incl. progressive rejection + Adobe CMYK); full Rust 354 passing, fmt/clippy clean; frontend 228 + E2E 43/43 + 4 SKIP unchanged (DCT renders identically in PDF.js).

## Known limitations (by design, not defects)

- **L1 — Compress disabled.** The Studio action stays disabled; no engine or UI implementation exists yet. See `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
- **L2 — Password-protected PDFs unsupported.** Reported as `UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT`, never attempted. UI copy: "This PDF needs a password, which is not supported yet."
- **L3 — Metadata empty-string set rejected.** Reading preserves `Some("")` distinctly from absent; _setting_ `""` is rejected — use `Clear` (engine rule, `engine/src/processing/pdf/metadata/`).
- **L4 — Inspect is structural only.** No text extraction, rendering, or image extraction (`engine/src/processing/pdf/inspect/mod.rs`).
- **L5 — Images → PDF is JPEG/PNG only.** Other formats fail as `UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT` (engine rule, `image` crate features `jpeg`+`png`).

## Resolved

### F-7 — Mobile bottom nav wrapping into two rows and covering content

- **Status.** Resolved. **Area.** Studio shell (`app/src/studio/StudioApp.tsx` `MobileNav`). **Severity.** Medium (footer and bottom content unreachable behind the nav on phones).
- **Symptoms.** The nav grid was `grid-cols-4` but held 8 destinations (Home + 7 tools), wrapping to ~135px-tall two rows while the page reserved only `pb-[76px]`; cells ~44px wide with 9.5px labels.
- **Root cause.** Grid sized when the tool list was shorter; never resized as tools grew to 7.
- **Fix.** Single-row horizontally scrolling strip (snap, hidden scrollbar, 56px touch height, 10px labels); page bottom padding (`pb-[92px]`) applied only when the nav renders.
- **Verification.** Frontend-only on a Rust-less machine: eslint clean, prettier clean, vitest 118/118. Full suite re-verified on the Rust-capable side 2026-09-23: Rust 345 tests, `fmt`/`clippy` clean, WASM build passing, typecheck/lint/format clean, 118 unit tests, production build (PWA SW, 34 precache entries, zero testbench strings), canonical E2E 21/21 + 4 SKIP without the optional corpus, optional suites exit 0 with explicit SKIP — baselines unchanged, patch bumped to v1.7.1.

### F-8 — Hero proof-line clipped on small phones

- **Status.** Resolved. **Area.** Home (`app/src/studio/Home.tsx`). **Severity.** Low (text cut off, no function lost).
- **Symptoms.** The "0 servers · 100% browser · ∞ free" row was `whitespace-nowrap` at 13px — wider than a 360px viewport — and body `overflow-x-hidden` clipped it.
- **Fix.** Wraps below `sm` (`flex-wrap`, kept single-line on larger screens).

### F-9 — Rearrange touch-drag capturing page scroll

- **Status.** Resolved. **Area.** Rearrange tool (`app/src/studio/tools/RearrangeTool.tsx`). **Severity.** Medium (primary reorder gesture unusable on touch; arrows were the only reliable path).
- **Symptoms.** Vertical `Reorder` list with no drag handle: touch gestures on rows were captured by drag instead of scrolling the page.
- **Fix.** Drag starts only from a grip handle (`dragControls` + `dragListener={false}`); rows keep `touch-action: pan-y` so the page scrolls normally. Arrow buttons enlarged (`px-3 py-1`); helper copy now names the handle.

### F-10 — Dead bottom padding on mobile Home/About

- **Status.** Resolved with F-7. **Area.** Studio shell. **Severity.** Low (76px empty space).
- **Symptoms.** `pb-[76px]` applied on every mobile page although the nav renders only inside tools.
- **Fix.** The padding applies only when the nav renders (`showMobileNav`).

### F-1 — WASM wall-clock panic (`std::time` on `wasm32-unknown-unknown`)

- **Status.** Resolved. **Area.** Engine timing (`engine/src/core/clock.rs`, `engine/src/observability/timing.rs`). **Severity.** High (every timed WASM execution would panic).
- **Symptoms.** `std::time::{SystemTime, Instant}` panic on the WASM target (verified against the toolchain's `sys/pal/wasm`).
- **Root cause.** The WASM target has no OS clock backend for Rust `std::time`.
- **Fix.** Platform clock abstraction: native uses `std::time`, WASM uses JS-backed clocks via `js-sys` (WASM-only dependency, gated by target cfg). Documented in `Cargo.toml` comments.
- **Verification.** WASM build passes; `engineDurationMs` reported correctly in browser E2E (e.g. merge completion metadata).
- **Related lesson.** `docs/LESSONS.md` L-1.

### F-2 — PDF.js ArrayBuffer detachment neutering engine bytes

- **Status.** Resolved. **Area.** Rendering intake (`app/src/rendering/PdfJsRenderEngine.ts`). **Severity.** High (data corruption vector).
- **Symptoms.** PDF.js detaches (neuters) the buffer handed to `loadDocument`; sharing the studio store's buffer would destroy the document bytes.
- **Root cause.** Transfer semantics of the PDF.js loading API.
- **Fix.** Defensive copy at the rendering boundary; the studio store keeps the original.
- **Verification.** Comment at `PdfJsRenderEngine.ts:128`; E2E operates on documents after rendering intake with no corruption.
- **Related lesson.** `docs/LESSONS.md` L-2.

### F-3 — Unbounded thumbnail canvas / object-URL retention

- **Status.** Resolved. **Area.** Studio thumbnails (`app/src/studio/services/folio.ts`). **Severity.** High (tab memory growth, fatal on large files).
- **Symptoms.** Canvases and object URLs accumulated per thumbnail with no release; large documents ballooned memory.
- **Root cause.** No ownership discipline for transient render artifacts.
- **Fix.** Canvas bitmaps released on URL encode; object-URL cache LRU-bounded to 6 documents with revocation on evict/close; windows of 24 pages at concurrency 2.
- **Verification.** Large-file E2E: 2585-page document renders 24 thumbnail images, zero console errors.
- **Related lesson.** `docs/LESSONS.md` L-3.

### F-4 — Unbounded engine event-log growth (Testbench store)

- **Status.** Resolved (by removal + bounding discipline). **Area.** Former Developer Testbench (`stores/testbench.ts`, since deleted). **Severity.** Medium (dev-tool DOM/memory growth).
- **Symptoms.** Unbounded `pastExecutions` map retained full event histories; documented in the root `ARCHITECTURE.md` developer-console notes.
- **Root cause.** History retained without bound for developer inspection.
- **Fix.** Testbench application removed from the product entirely; production paths never retain unbounded event lists (`EngineExecution.events` is per-job and job-scoped).
- **Verification.** Production bundle scan: zero testbench strings; E2E passes with no DOM growth assertions failing (bounded 24-image DOM on the large file).
- **Related lesson.** `docs/LESSONS.md` L-4.

### F-5 — Cancellation lifecycle races

- **Status.** Resolved. **Area.** Studio jobs + engine cancellation (`folio.ts` `runStudioOperation`, `engine/src/execution/cancellation.rs`). **Severity.** High (untrusted cancel button).
- **Symptoms.** Cancel issued before the adapter handle existed could be lost; thumbnail work survived document close.
- **Root cause.** Async handle creation vs. synchronous user intent; independent thumbnail job lifetimes.
- **Fix.** `cancelled` flag races safely with handle creation (cancel-after-create guaranteed); thumbnail jobs tracked per document and cancelled en masse on close; `CANCELLED` is a terminal status with its own code and message.
- **Verification.** E2E `merge cancellation surfaces honestly in UI`; large-file E2E exercises cancellation paths.
- **Related lesson.** `docs/LESSONS.md` L-6.

### F-6 — Merge progress scale misreporting

- **Status.** Resolved during v1.7.0 integration. **Area.** Studio Merge tool progress plumbing. **Severity.** Medium (dishonest progress).
- **Symptoms.** Progress fraction did not reflect the engine's reported scale.
- **Root cause.** UI-side progress computation instead of direct engine-event mapping.
- **Fix.** Progress renders engine `percentage`/`message` directly (see `docs/WORKLOG.md` v1.7.0 entry).
- **Verification.** E2E merge assertions on real progress labels.
- **Related lesson.** `docs/LESSONS.md` L-5.

### F-11 — Zoom slider reported wrong scale (control removed)

- **Status.** Resolved by removal (revisit with focal-accurate handling). **Area.** Scanner camera dock (`app/src/studio/tools/CameraCapture.tsx`, `cameraCapabilities.ts`). **Severity.** Medium (the control lied to users about the optical state).
- **Symptoms.** The zoom slider showed "1.0×" while the device was actually using its ultrawide lens (real ~0.6×) — the track's reported zoom range is a device-internal scale, not a focal-length multiplier, so any displayed value was misleading.
- **Root cause.** `MediaStreamTrack.getCapabilities().zoom` exposes an arbitrary per-device numeric range with no guaranteed mapping to focal length or lens choice; browsers/phones may switch physical lenses behind a single "1×" value.
- **Fix.** The zoom control (slider, state, `applyConstraints({ advanced: [{ zoom }] })` path, capability model field) was removed entirely; the camera dock keeps torch only. Documented for re-introduction (ROADMAP "Future / not committed") once a focal-accurate approach is available.
- **Verification.** Unit tests assert no zoom control renders even when the track reports a zoom range (`CameraCapture.test.tsx`, `cameraCapabilities.test.ts`); canonical E2E asserts `zoomControls === 0` in the scanner surface check.

### F-12 — Stale code-split chunk 404 after a deploy ("Failed to fetch dynamically imported module")

- **Status.** Resolved (recovery UX + cache retention). **Area.** Deploy/service-worker boundary (`app/vite.config.ts`, shared `ErrorBlock`, lazy engine-adapter import). **Severity.** High (builds fail with an undebuggable raw fetch error; user cannot proceed without knowing to reload).
- **Symptoms.** After a Cloudflare Pages deploy, an already-open page from the previous deployment failed its next lazy import (`.../assets/WasmWorkerEngineAdapter-<hash>.js` → 404) and surfaced the raw exception text as a red build error. Seen on a real phone mid-build with 44 images staged.
- **Root cause.** Deploy skew: the new service worker activates and (by default) deletes the previous deployment precaches, while the still-open old page keeps old chunk hashes that no longer exist on hosting. Retrying the operation can never succeed — only a reload to the current shell helps.
- **Fix.** Two layers: (1) `ErrorBlock` detects stale-chunk failures across bundler message shapes and renders "A new version of Folio was released…" with an explicit Reload button (raw URL kept as secondary diagnostics) — covers every tool at once, consistent with the existing lazy-route recovery copy. (2) `cleanupOutdatedCaches: false` so a new SW no longer deletes the previous deployment chunks out from under open pages (browser quota eviction is the backstop).
- **Verification.** New `ui.test.tsx` (bundler message shapes, null-safety, recovery rendering, ordinary-error passthrough); canonical E2E 41/41 + 4 SKIP.

### F-15 — Scanner viewfinder shrinks after the first capture (phone)

- **Status.** Resolved (stable layout). **Area.** Scanner shell (`app/src/studio/tools/CameraCapture.tsx`). **Severity.** Medium (framing gets harder with every capture; reported with before/after screenshots).
- **Symptoms.** Pre-capture the viewfinder filled the screen; after one capture it lost ~130px to three newcomers: the top bar wrapping onto two rows (View-pages CTA), the in-flow "Added as photo" note strip, and the session thumbnail strip.
- **Root cause.** The viewport flexes to leftover column space, so every in-flow sibling added post-capture stole from it directly.
- **Fix.** Top bar is single-row nowrap (truncating title, short "Pages (n)" CTA <400px, `shrink-0` buttons; device picker moved to the bottom hint row); the import note became a floating auto-dismissing (5s) pill over the viewport instead of an in-flow strip; the session strip stays in-flow below the dock (E2E layering contract) but slimmer with no duplicate safe-area padding.
- **Verification.** New E2E check: narrow-phone framing-box height before vs after first capture — 263px → 263px, pixel-identical; canonical E2E 44/44 + 4 SKIP.

### F-16 — Gallery PNG imports build 100 MB+ PDFs (camera JPEGs stayed small)

- **Status.** Resolved (PNG→JPEG at import). **Area.** App import path (`app/src/studio/tools/imageImport.ts`, `ImagesTool.tsx`). Engine untouched. **Severity.** High (same class as F-14, other half: scanner Import + Add-images gallery entries).
- **Symptoms.** Camera captures (always JPEG → DCT passthrough) built tiny PDFs, but gallery imports (PNG screenshots/photos retained byte-identical within budget) embedded as uncompressed raw RGB — 100 MB+ outputs.
- **Root cause.** `prepareImportFile` retained within-budget originals regardless of format; `addFiles` never normalized at all. PNG has no engine DCT path by design (lossless raw), so retained PNG bytes exploded.
- **Fix.** PNGs always convert to white-filled JPEG at import (budget-clamped, `.jpg` rename — truthful, matches scan naming); `Add images`/DropZone now run the same normalized `importFiles` path with progress text instead of raw `addFiles`. JPEG behavior unchanged (originals retained).
- **Verification.** New unit tests (PNG conversion identity, JPEG retention); E2E upload block updated for the rename + still builds; canonical E2E 45/45 + 4 SKIP.
